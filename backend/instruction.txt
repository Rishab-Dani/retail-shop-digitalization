🧠 Senior Dev Way: How to Create a Pull Request (Step by Step)

You already did the hard part (commits + push).
Creating a PR is mostly UI clicks.

✅ STEP 1: Push your branch (you already did this)

You already ran:

git push origin backend-dev


✔ This is required before a PR can exist.

✅ STEP 2: Open GitHub Repository

Go to your repo on GitHub

You’ll usually see a banner like:

“backend-dev had recent pushes”

👉 Click “Compare & pull request”

If you don’t see it, no problem — use Step 3.

✅ STEP 3: Create PR Manually (Always Works)

On GitHub, click Pull requests tab

Click New pull request

Now select:

Base branch: main

Compare branch: backend-dev

GitHub will show the changes.

✅ STEP 4: Fill Pull Request Details (Important)
Title (clear & professional)
Add product entity and initial DB schema

Description (short & meaningful)
- Added Product entity
- Enabled Hibernate table auto-creation
- Verified PostgreSQL connection


This shows engineering clarity.

✅ STEP 5: Create & Merge

Click Create pull request

Review changes (quick look)

Click Merge pull request

Click Confirm merge

🎉 Done.

✅ STEP 6: Sync Local Branches (Very Important)

Back in IntelliJ terminal:

git checkout main
git pull origin main


Then update your dev branch:

git checkout backend-dev
git pull origin main


This keeps everything clean.
